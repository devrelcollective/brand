Our logos and assets for sharing the good DevRel world

## New Logo! 

We're going with the avocado theme of DevRel a la Mary's book. An early revision of one is in the repo. We'd love others to make alternative designs and share via a PR.

Notes: 

- `.pxm` is for [Pixelmator for MacOS](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) because idk how to Illustrator `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
- Other versions or new ideas are welcome in the `/experiments` folder

## Name and logo usage

We kindly request that the community name and/or logo of the Devrel Collective not be used without our express written permission. The best way to do this in public is to create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/devrelcollective/brand/issues).
